<h2>
  Why is diversity in children's books important?
</h2>

<h4>
  Half of young readers belong to a minority group.
</h4>

<p>
  According to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/population/cb13-112.html" target="_blank">2012 Census</a>, 49.9% of children younger than five belong to a minority group.
</p>

<h4>
  Less than 8% of children's books are about, or written/illustrated by, people of color.
</h4>

<p>
  Of the 3,600 books received by the <a href="http://www.education.wisc.edu/ccbc/books/choiceintro13.asp" target="_blank">Cooperative Children's Book Center</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's School of Education, less than 300 books had significant content or themes, topics, and characters that are African, African America, American Indian, Asian/Pacific, Asian/Pacific American, or Latino.
</p>

<h4>
  Children's books should be enjoyable and educational.
</h4>

<p>
  Children should be able to read books that mirror the diversity of the United States population. By adding diversity to children's books, their educational value increases.
